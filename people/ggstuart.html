      <p>
        I'm module leader and have a few decades of experience with web development.
        I've built a few large systems for research projects over the years.
        Also several small ones for research, teaching etc. I also wrote a book on
        JavaScript game development.

        If your lab tutor can't help, maybe I can. If you think so then work with your tutor
        to formulate a sensible question. You can email me or ask in the lectures.

        <p>
          I was thinking about a university webpage for listing available degree programmes.
          It would need an admin dashboard for setting up programmes and modules.
          The student-facing pages would need to be really easy to use.
